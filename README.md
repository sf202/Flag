# Flag
Write an assembly program to test if the flag 0x10 is set in the register %10. If it is set, then multiply the content of 
%10 by 2 using the appropriate shift instruction and exit immediately. If it is not set, then divide the content of %10 by 2 using the appropriate 
shift instruction and exit. You may test your program when %10 is equal to 0x18 and when %10 is equal to 0x08.
